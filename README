Implementation:
        Correctly Implemented:
                We have successfully implemented the foundational components of 
                both Part A and Part B. For Part A, our readaline function 
                correctly reads lines from input streams with proper memory 
                allocation, error handling, and EOF detection. The function 
                uses dynamic buffer allocation with helper functions for NULL 
                checking and file error validation. For Part B, our restoration
                program properly handles command-line arguments, file I/O 
                operations including stdin support, and includes comprehensive 
                exception handling with TRY/EXCEPT blocks. We have implemented 
                helper functions for file management, PGM header creation, and 
                basic data structure operations. The program correctly outputs 
                to stdout in P5 format and manages memory appropriately.

        Not Correctly Implemented: Hopefully nothing :D?
